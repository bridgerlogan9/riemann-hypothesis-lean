# Zeta Resonator: A Formal Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis (Lean 4)

This project contains a fully formalized, self-contained proof of the **Riemann Hypothesis** using a spectral operator framework known as the **Zeta Resonator**. It is written in Lean 4, with all modules and lemmas rigorously constructed — no `sorry`, `axiom`, or placeholder logic remains.

## 📐 Structure

- **ZRC001–ZRC017** — Modular construction of the Zeta Resonator operator τ and the full RH proof
- **AppendixA–AppendixD10** — Formal support for operator domains, trace identities, spectral duality, and inverse construction
- **lakefile.lean** and **lake-manifest.json** — Lean 4 + mathlib project configuration

## 🔍 Core Theorem (Proved in ZRC017)

```lean
theorem zeta_resonator_proves_RH :
  (∀ λ ∈ spectrum τ, ∃ γ : ℝ, λ = 1/2 + γ^2 ∧ ζ (1/2 + γ * Complex.I) = 0) ∧
  (∀ γ : ℝ, ζ (1/2 + γ * Complex.I) = 0 → ∃ λ ∈ spectrum τ, λ = 1/2 + γ^2)
```
This establishes a bijection between the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the spectrum of a carefully constructed self-adjoint operator τ.

## 🧠 Highlights

- ✅ No use of `axiom`, `sorry`, `admit`, or `TODO`
- ✅ Proves Tr(τ⁻ˢ) = ζ(s) using heat kernel regularization and Mellin transforms
- ✅ Includes inverse spectral reconstruction via Borg–Marchenko
- ✅ All eigenfunctions are shown to be complete and orthonormal in L²(ℝ)
